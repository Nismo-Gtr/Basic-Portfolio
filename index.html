        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p><img src="./assets/images/bio_pic,jpg.jpeg" alt="">My name is Nicholas Cowan, I am a coding enthusiast who is psyched to be a part of the Northwestern coding bootcamp.
            I am a big soccer fan, my favorite team is Newcastle United even though they have had a rough decade. I have been listening to a lot of grime lately, my favorite artists would have to be Kano. I also really enjoy cars, especially working on them.
            </p><br>
            <p>I have been learning bits and pieces of front end web development over the last year or so, and while frustrating at times have absolutely loved it. </p>
